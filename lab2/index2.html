                    <p style="color: rgb(64, 73, 157);">Hey my name is Maya! I like to draw in my freetime, and for work sometimes. I've designed a logo for a race, and stickers for small businesses! Not too familiar with coding yet but excited to keep going with it!</stylecolor></p><p style="color: rgb(233, 73, 15);">My name is Grace Galan and I am a 4th year Lit major at UCSC. My favorite books are Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and Parable of the Sower. I want to teach high school English Lit when I am done with school. In my free time I love to make art, spend time with my friends, and explore new coffee shops.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: rgb(233, 73, 15);">Challenge</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgb(64, 73, 157);">The challenge of this lab was to create a new wepage, edit it with html (to build it) and css (to make it look super cool), and then use GitHub to make the site available online!</p>

                    <h2 style="color: rgb(64, 73, 157);">Problems</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgb(233, 73, 15);">The Canvas assignment and the Lab 2 template indicated different directions. Grace's TA, Ilia, taught her how to create a new index.hmtl which Grace then taught Maya. We took the approach of combining the requirments of the canvas and lab2 template on VSCode both to ensure we got full point, regardless of what was correct.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: rgb(233, 73, 15);">Reflection</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgb(64, 73, 157);">This assignment was fun, in that we were able to experiment a little more with CSS and styling, as well as organizing HTML! We decided to take it a step further, and give each other the space to style our own version of the Lab webpage. Which, I think not only let us get a better grasp on CSS and coding, but also let us express ourselves creatively with this lab!</p>

                    <p style="color: rgb(233, 73, 15);" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" style="font-size: xx-large;">THE VERY THING YE BE FEASTING YER EYES UPON! The only real issue we faced was being unable to publish our website(s) to be publicly accesable through GitHub, but, I am at least happy with our results!</p>
