                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p>I had an issue with a text box window drop down showing up before my page loaded. I'm not sure how that happened, but was able to get it fixed and removed. The other main issue I faced was getting my button to provide results visible on the page, but later found it was just another small coding error.</p>

                <div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>I am still trying to get the hang of paying attention to the little details when it comes to coding, it is easy to get lose in the html/js when you're looking at it for long periods of time. I think that I'm definitely getting a better hang of/undersanding of JS and jQuery as a whole, though! These labs, for the most part, are not as daunting as I thought they would be at the start of the course.</p>
