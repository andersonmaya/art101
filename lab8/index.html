			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were tasked with creating a new file to link into VScode, linking javascript in a new way, and develop an array.map function, replicating what we did in class!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There weren't any issues with the actual lab, the main problem we had was figuring out the bonus Task X. Other than that, the lab process went fairly smoothly!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put in a good amount of energy into this assignment. Especially with attempting to outsource for Task X to display the console.log on the page, we just weren't able to figure it out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>Expand the console to see!</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
