			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Trasnfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload our work to be available online through github!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some issues came up, but nothing with the coding. Mostly, it was understanding which screenshots to submit, as it wasn't totally clear. But, we figured it out!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this assignment wasn't too bad, the coding aspect was pretty straight forward and easy to undersand. It definitely helped to work with a partner, so answer any immediate questions that came up during the process of finishing the lab.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We were able to add selfies of ourselves to our personal websites, make an ordered list linking all labs for the course, and finish up this Lab summary!</p>
