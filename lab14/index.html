                        <p>The challenge of this lab was to debug and revisit old labs.</p>

                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p>The main issue I had with this lab was not having anything to debug, so I went back and completed a Task X</p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>This lab was not difficult content wise, it was just difficult thinking of what to do for it. As there was no debugging, I looked for outsourcing materials, and ended up following a yotube tutorial on how to crate a toggle button to change up my website for lab 11.</p>

                        <p id="title">This is my code for my toggle button in Lab 11, as well as the button itself!</p>
