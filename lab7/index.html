					<h2 style="color: #40499d;">Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a working function, as well as make a new folder with css, img, and javascript, and html files + successfully link it to our page!</p>

					<h2 style="color: #40499d;">Problems</h2>
					<p>There weren't too many problems, the biggest issue was fully understanding the task and what exactly we were meant to input into JavaScript. We used our best judgement.</p>

					<h2 style="color: #40499d;">Reflection</h2>
					<p>We put a good amount of energy into this assignment, and worked to use similar code as per the example provided in canvas, but also to tweak it a little to make it our own. This was done by adding in a lower-case command into the javascript, to make the results of the name scrambler/word generator flow better, in case the user input a singular capital letter. Which would end up just being a random capitalized letter in the generator result.</p>
